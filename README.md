# Soft-Acoustic-Curvature-SAC-sensor
This research focuses on design and development of a Soft Acoustic Curvature (SAC) sensor. An AI model has been developed to establish the correlation between sound amplitude and the curvature of the sensor. An acoustic channel was considered inside the soft structure affected by bending.

Figure1. Soft Acoustic Curvature
 
We have Prepared dataset using known curvatures and 1000 samples and then Trained different Machine Learning models.

Figure2. Curvature test objects ranging from 0 to 60 m-1 and Variation of the recorded amplitude with curvature for each frequency
 
To select the appropriate Machine Learning model the validation error played a crucial role. According to Figure3 Rational quadratic Gaussian process regression model showed the best performance.
